 ->  1. Be pycodestyle compliant! - Write beautiful code that passes the pycodestyle checks.

 -> 2. Unittests - All your files, classes, functions must be tested with unit tests

 -> 3. BaseModel - Write a class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes.

 -> 4. Create BaseModel from dictionary - Previously we created a method to generate a dictionary representation of an instance (method to_dict()).
		* Now it’s time to re-create an instance with this dictionary representation.

 -> 5. Store first object - Now we can recreate a BaseModel from another one by using a dictionary representation.
